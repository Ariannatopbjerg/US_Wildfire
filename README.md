## Selected topic
We will be observing wildfires across the United States to see which parts of the United States has the highest frequency of fires. 

## Reason why we selected this topic
Since wildfires are increasing in California compared to past years, we would like to see if other states/counties in this country are experiencing the same. 

## Description of source of data
This dataset is a sub-sample from [1.88 Million US Fires]( https://www.kaggle.com/rtatman/188-million-us-wildfires) combined with historical weather and vegetation data from the website Kaggle. 

### Source
U.S. Wildfire data (plus other attributes). https://www.kaggle.com/capcloudcoder/us-wildfire-data-plus-other-attributes?select=FW_Veg_Rem_Combined.csv


## Questions we hope to answer with this data
2. How does population growth, weather, and terrain affect wildfire occuring in an area in US?

1. Predict the probability of a fire event happening in a certain area:
Random forest or decision trees (supervised learning)
Compare both models. Pick one with the better accuracy.


Measuring pop, weather, terrain

Machine learning:
Features: 
Humidity
Precipitation 
Wind
Lat/long
Population density per county (24 years)
Terrain 

What to do: 
3 and 1

Dependent variables:
Will there be increase of fire?
Will it be devastating?
