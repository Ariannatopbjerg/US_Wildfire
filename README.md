Notes from Thursday evening colaboration:

Questions: 

How does population growth and migration effect wildfires in the US.

Ultimate questionss:
Build a machine learning model to predict what is the likelihood that the fire would grow to devastating proportions.

Machine learning: 
features: 1.88 million subset file data (humidity, precipitation, wind, lat/long... etc), we need another dataset for population/county
over 24 yeras (similar data duration as 1.88 million wild fire data). 

dependent variable: 
will there be fire?
will it be devasting? 

To do:
find data set for population by county
define devastating
convert lat/long to county

supervised machine learning: we don't currently know if/where fires

How does weather, populataion and terrain effect fire occurance.
