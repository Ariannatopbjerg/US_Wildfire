# US_Wildfire Segment 4


## Project Overview
Analyzed wildfires across the United States. The members of our team live or have lived in the Bay Area of California. A few years ago, when the fires were running rampant, we all experienced ashes raining from the sky and not being able to see the sun for days. This topic touches us personally and piques our interest. To know more about this topic and future potential wildfires, we want to see if it is possible to predict future fire sizes from past fire data. This dataset that we chose, is a sub-sample from [1.88 Million US Fires]( https://www.kaggle.com/rtatman/188-million-us-wildfires) combined with historical weather and vegetation data from the website Kaggle. The question that we want to answer with this data is to determine at what accuracy if any, can we predict the class size of a fire.

## Resources
Utilized Panda's profiling to visualize metadata of the original dataset. [Removed nulls](https://github.com/Ariannatopbjerg/US_Wildfire/blob/main/Notebooks/wildfire_cleanup_pt3.ipynb), [checked for duplicates](https://github.com/Ariannatopbjerg/US_Wildfire/blob/main/Notebooks/Wildfire_cleanup_pt1.ipynb), and [removed noncontributing data](https://github.com/Ariannatopbjerg/US_Wildfire/blob/main/Notebooks/wildfire_cleanup_pt2.ipynb). Used random forest classification model integrated with postgresSQL. Listed below are the numerous technology, programming language and tools we have utilized: 

- Jupyter Notebook 
- PostgresSQL 
- Flask app 
- Leaflet
- Heroku
- APIs
- Python
- HTML
- Javascript
- SQL
- Machine Learning Random Forest Classifier

## Machine Learning Model 
- Utilized Panda's profiling to visualize metadata of the original dataset. Removed nulls, checked for duplicates, and removed noncontributing data.
- Removed features after initial machine learning model due to a negative accuracy score of -117% using Random Forest Regressor model. 
- Removed additional features to improve accuracy score.
- Elected random sampling for splitting, training, and testing dataset.
- Confirmed to use Random Forest Machine Learning Model in lieu of using Decision Trees due to better performance. Limitations for Random Forest are greater time required for training as it combines a lot of decision trees to determine the class as well as requiring much computational power and resources as it builds numerous trees to combine their outputs. 
- Used Random Forest Classifier instead of Random Forest Regressor since the prediction will be categorical and not continuous.
- A useful article that explains grid searches and the various hyperparameters that can be used for this model:["Hyperparameter Tuning the Random Forest in Python"]( https://towardsdatascience.com/hyperparameter-tuning-the-random-forest-in-python-using-scikit-learn-28d2aa77dd74. 
- The initial accuracy score of the Random Forest Classifier model was 91%. This was due to a high correlation between the feature fire size and the dependent variable fire size class. 
- Additional training was completed with changed features and hyperparameters to correct the high correlation. The new model predicts the fire size class with an accuracy score of 70%.

### Confusion Matrix
The confusion matrix shows that during the splitting of the test and train samples for our model, fire size class d and e did not split properly, giving 0s in the confusion matrix. Analyzing the data; shown in the pie chart, the classes are imbalanced. For this, we attempted to do a test/train split for each of the six fire size classes, concatenate all the classes together, then oversampled and undersampled the minority classes so the majority and minority classes are balanced in the training set. The outcome of testing to see if oversampling or undersampling would fix the imbalance of the classes were inconclusive. The results for both scenarios were similar to the initial confusion matrix. The only difference were the accuracy scores. Both gave lower accuracy scores compared to the initial model.

### Future statistical analysis

## Database 
[Database connection](https://github.com/Ariannatopbjerg/US_Wildfire/blob/main/Notebooks/Wildfire_DB_Connect.ipynb)

[SQL database code](https://github.com/Ariannatopbjerg/US_Wildfire/tree/main/sql)

In the database connection code, you will see the creation of a new dataset for counties. The data was scraped from the [Federal Communications Commission]( https://geo.fcc.gov/api/census/) with the latitudes and longitudes from the Wildfire dataset. Then the two datasets were [joined together](https://github.com/Ariannatopbjerg/US_Wildfire/blob/main/images/join_code.png); shown below, using PostgreSQL. Used SQLAlchemy for the connection string between the database and jupyter notebook.
