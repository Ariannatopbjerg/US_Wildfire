# project_one
group project

Our project consists of analyzing fire data to determine at what accuracy if any, can we predict the next devastating fire. 
We will clean the input data set to ultimately demonstrate that we can have any desired results, and that the data can be biased to begin with.
Our bias is that CA has the most devasting, most costly, most frequent wild fires than any other state over the last 5 years.
We will utilize the last 24 years of data to predict the next 5 years. 

Team communication via: 
slack, google meet, and office hour breakout rooms. 


Reason we selected this topic:

The members of our team were all California residents in the bay area. We all experienced ashes raining from the sky, 
not being able to see the sun for days, and this topic touches us personally and peaks our interest to see if it's 
possible to predict future fires based on past fire data.
