## Selected topic
We will be observing wildfires across the United States to see which parts of the United States has the highest frequency of fires. 

## Reason why we selected this topic
Since wildfires are increasing in California compared to past years, we would like to see if other states/counties in this country are experiencing the same. 

## Description of source of data
This dataset is a sub-sample from [1.88 Million US Fires]( https://www.kaggle.com/rtatman/188-million-us-wildfires) combined with historical weather and vegetation data from the website Kaggle. 

### Source
U.S. Wildfire data (plus other attributes). https://www.kaggle.com/capcloudcoder/us-wildfire-data-plus-other-attributes?select=FW_Veg_Rem_Combined.csv

## Question we hope to answer with this data
1. Are other states experiencing an increase in fire frequency compared to past years?

## Machine Learning Model Brainstorm:
- Supervised learning: Random Forest or Decision Trees (compare both models for best fit)
- Model Features:
  - Weather (Humidity, Precipitation, Wind, Temperature)
  - Lat/Long
  - Population density per county 
  - Type of fire
