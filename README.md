group project

Our project consists of analyzing fire data to determine at what accuracy if any, can we predict the next devastating fire. 
We will clean the input data set to ultimately demonstrate that we can have any desired results, and that the data can be biased to begin with.
Our bias is that CA has the most devasting, most costly, most frequent wild fires than any other state over the last 5 years.
We will utilize the last 24 years of data to predict the next 5 years.
